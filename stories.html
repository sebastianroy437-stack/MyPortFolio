<h1 class="h1">My Star Stories</h1>
<p class="p">Sebastian Roy's journey in hospitality began with a deep curiosity about how hotels function behind the scenes. During his Bachelor of Hotel Management studies, he grabbed every chance to learn beyond textbooks. His experiences across different properties and events have shaped him into a professional who is not only eager to grow but also ready to contribute to the efficiency, culture, and success of any organization he becomes part of.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Professional Experiences</h2>
<div class="grid grid-2">
<div class="card">
<h3>The Ritz-Carlton, Bangalore</h3>
<p>Sebastian's first major step was at The Ritz-Carlton, Bangalore, where he experienced the pulse of luxury hospitality during his industrial training. Here, he observed how meticulous service, teamwork, and precision come together to create unforgettable guest experiences.</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>INS Vikranth Mark II Launching Ceremony</h3>
<p>Soon after, Sebastian was entrusted with a unique opportunity — being part of the service team for Marriott's "INS Vikranth Mark II Launching Ceremony." This wasn't just another event; it was a high-profile gathering where discipline, elegance, and flawless execution mattered at every second. The experience sharpened his ability to handle pressure while still carrying a smile.</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Kerala Travel Mart</h3>
<p>Beyond hotel operations, he also volunteered at the Kerala Travel Mart, one of the largest tourism networking events in India. Engaging with professionals, entrepreneurs, and international delegates broadened his perspective on global tourism trends and reinforced his passion for promoting responsible and sustainable travel practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Crowne Plaza Kochi</h3>
<p>His training journey continued at Crowne Plaza Kochi, where he entered the Purchase Department. Instead of being limited to observation, he actively contributed by assisting in receiving goods, checking quality and quantity, and even managing the process independently when the associate was on leave. Handling responsibilities on his own gave him a real taste of accountability and built his confidence in operations management.</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>Taj Kumarakom Resort & Spa</h3>
<p>Adding another dimension, Sebastian explored the Finance and Human Resources Department at Taj Kumarakom Resort & Spa. Here, he understood the backbone of hotel operations — from managing budgets to handling employee relations. This exposure connected his passion for people with the numbers that drive decisions, fueling his interest in human resources as a career path.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p" style="margin-top: 24px;">Together, these experiences gave him a 360-degree view of the hospitality industry — from frontline service to back-end administration. They shaped him into a professional who is not only eager to grow but also ready to contribute to the efficiency, culture, and success of any organization he becomes part of.</p>
